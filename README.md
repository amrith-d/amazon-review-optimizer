## üéØ **Week 1: Foundation Series** *(Current)*

**Goal:** Establish credibility with concrete, measurable results

### This Week's Challenge
Build an LLM cost optimizer using Stanford's Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset (10,000+ reviews)

**Target Metrics:**
- ‚úÖ Process 1,000+ real Amazon reviews across Electronics, Books, Home & Garden
- ‚úÖ Achieve 90%+ cost reduction through smart routing and caching
- ‚úÖ Document every optimization technique for enterprise application
