🌊 THE COST REDUCTION WATERFALL:

Starting from $1.50 baseline (GPT-4 for everything):
→ Smart Routing: -96.7% ($1.45 saved)
→ Semantic Cache: -3.1% ($0.046 additional saved)  
→ Final Result: $0.003849 (99.74% total reduction)

This waterfall shows EXACTLY where each optimization technique contributes to the phenomenal cost reduction. Smart routing does the heavy lifting, but caching makes it virtually free.
