**ðŸ”¬ THE INFRASTRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION STEPS WE'RE IMPLEMENTING:**

**STEP 1: Hardware-Aware Optimization Engine**
```python
class HardwareAwareOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hardware_profiles = {
            'H100': {'memory': 80, 'compute': 989, 'precision': ['fp16', 'bf16', 'fp8'], 'cost_per_hour': 8.0},
            'A100': {'memory': 40, 'compute': 312, 'precision': ['fp16', 'bf16'], 'cost_per_hour': 4.0},
            'L4': {'memory': 24, 'compute': 121, 'precision': ['fp16', 'int8'], 'cost_per_hour': 1.2},
            'T4': {'memory': 16, 'compute': 65, 'precision': ['fp16', 'int8', 'int4'], 'cost_per_hour': 0.526}
        }
        
    def select_optimal_hardware(self, workload: WorkloadProfile) -> HardwareAllocation:
        optimal_allocations = []
        
        for hw_type, specs in self.hardware_profiles.items():
            # Calculate efficiency score
            memory_efficiency = min(workload.memory_required / specs['memory'], 1.0)
            compute_efficiency = min(workload.compute_required / specs['compute'], 1.0)
            precision_match = 1.0 if workload.precision in specs['precision'] else 0.6
            
            cost_efficiency = (memory_efficiency * compute_efficiency * precision_match) / specs['cost_per_hour']
            
            optimal_allocations.append({
                'hardware': hw_type,
                'efficiency_score': cost_efficiency,
                'estimated_cost': specs['cost_per_hour'] * workload.processing_time_hours,
                'utilization': memory_efficiency * compute_efficiency

        }
        
    def optimize_precision_for_workload(self, workload: Workload, quality_threshold: float = 0.95) -> PrecisionConfig:
        optimal_precision = 'fp32'  # Conservative default
        
        for precision, metrics in self.precision_hierarchy.items():
            if metrics['accuracy'] >= quality_threshold:
                # Calculate total efficiency
                speed_benefit = metrics['speed_multiplier']
                memory_benefit = 1.0 / metrics['memory_multiplier']
                cost_benefit = speed_benefit * memory_benefit
                
                if cost_benefit > self.current_best_benefit:
                    optimal_precision = precision
                    self.current_best_benefit = cost_benefit
                    
        return PrecisionConfig(
            precision=optimal_precision,
            expected_speedup=self.precision_hierarchy[optimal_precision]['speed_multiplier'],
            memory_reduction=1.0 / self.precision_hierarchy[optimal_precision]['memory_multiplier'],
