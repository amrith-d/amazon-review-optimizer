## Post 1.1 (Monday) - The Challenge
**Title:** "Why I'm Analyzing 10,000+ Real Amazon Reviews This Week"

**Content Structure (from PDF):**
- Problem statement: Companies burning thousands on LLM costs without optimization strategies
- Hypothesis: Real-world data analysis will reveal the exact optimization patterns enterprise infrastructure needs

## Engagement Strategy (from PDF)
- Ask specific questions about optimization challenges to drive comments
- Share repository updates in real-time with live metrics  
- Cross-post to relevant LinkedIn groups (AI/ML Engineering, Technical Leadership)
- Tag relevant thought leaders in AI optimization and infrastructure
- Use hashtags: #LLMOptimization #CostReduction #AmazonData #AIInfrastructure
- End each post with actionable questions for audience engagement

## Additional Week 1 Requirements
- **Repository Setup**: Make public with progressive README updates
- **Scale to 1,000 reviews**: Expand from current 10 sample reviews
- **Real dataset integration**: Fix Amazon Reviews 2023 loading or use alternative
