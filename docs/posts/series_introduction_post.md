```
üö® THE HIDDEN AI COST CRISIS

Companies are burning $20K-50K+ monthly on AI infrastructure without realizing they could achieve the same results for $500-2,000.

The problem? Most organizations are using AI like a sledgehammer when they need a scalpel.

üéØ THE REAL PROBLEM ENTERPRISES FACE:

**Enterprise Reality Check:**
‚Ä¢ 80% of AI workloads don't need GPT-4 or Claude Opus
‚Ä¢ Companies pay $10-30 per million tokens when $0.15-0.50 would work
‚Ä¢ Zero optimization = 10-30x higher costs than necessary
‚Ä¢ Most CTOs don't even know this optimization is possible

**Why This Matters NOW:**
‚Ä¢ AI budgets are exploding (Gartner: 300% increase in 2024)
‚Ä¢ CFOs are demanding ROI on AI investments
‚Ä¢ Competition requires cost-efficient scaling
‚Ä¢ Infrastructure optimization = competitive advantage
