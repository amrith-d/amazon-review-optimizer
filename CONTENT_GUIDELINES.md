**CREDIBILITY ENFORCEMENT:**
- PRIORITY: Use only internally validated data from actual testing
- SECONDARY: Include verified external sources with direct links and publication dates
- PROHIBITED: Market generalizations, industry trends, or unverifiable third-party claims
- REQUIRED: When external sources unavailable, focus exclusively on demonstrated technical results

### 5. PROCESS-OVER-RESULTS ENFORCEMENT

**METHODOLOGY PRIORITIZATION:**
- REQUIRED: Emphasize implementation process, problem-solving methodology, and learning documentation
- PROHIBITED: Result-focused language without process context
- MANDATORY: Include challenges, failed approaches, and iterative improvements
- FOCUS: Technical methodology demonstration over outcome celebration

**PROCESS TRANSFORMATION:**
- ❌ "Achieved 63.3% cost reduction with optimal performance"
- ✅ "Systematic optimization methodology identified timeout constraints, implemented concurrent processing, and achieved 63.3% cost reduction through iterative testing"
- ❌ "Delivered production-ready optimization system"
- ✅ "Progressive implementation addressed sequential processing limitations, integrated timeout protection, and validated scalability through methodical testing"

### 6. NUMERICAL PRECISION ENFORCEMENT

**EXACT MEASUREMENT REQUIREMENTS:**
- MANDATORY: Use precise numbers from actual validation (e.g., 63.3%, 372 seconds, 2.70 rev/s)
- PROHIBITED: Rounded estimates or approximations ("around 60%", "roughly 2x faster")
- REQUIRED: Include specific testing conditions and scope parameters
- MANDATORY: Reference exact failure rates, error handling, and edge case performance

6. ✅ EXACT numerical precision (63.3%, 372 seconds, 2.70 rev/s)
7. ✅ SPECIFIC scope parameters clearly defined ("1,000-review validation")
8. ✅ WEEKLY context limitations explicitly stated

### SOURCE VERIFICATION AUDIT:
9. ✅ ALL external claims verified with direct source links or citations
10. ✅ NO unsourced industry statistics or market generalizations
11. ✅ PRIORITY given to internally validated data over external claims
