## üîç **Week 1 Mini-Reflection: Problem ‚Üí Approach ‚Üí What Worked/Didn't Work ‚Üí Results**

### **PROBLEM:**
Enterprise-scale AI cost optimization required processing 1,000 Amazon reviews cost-effectively while maintaining production-grade reliability and user experience.

### **APPROACH:**
Multiple solution strategies implemented and tested:
- **Simple Rule-Based Routing**: Length + category-based model selection for cost optimization
- **Sequential Processing**: One-by-one review processing for initial implementation simplicity
- **Template-Based Validation**: Simulated data testing for rapid development cycles
- **Bulk Data Loading**: Load entire 1,000-review dataset at once for quick processing
- **Basic Caching**: Simple content hashing for duplicate detection

### **WHAT DIDN'T WORK:**
- **Simple Routing Algorithm**: ALL Electronics reviews routed to premium models (153% cost INCREASE!)
- **Sequential Processing**: Complete system failure at 500+ reviews due to inevitable timeouts
- **Template-Based Testing**: 99% cache hits gave false confidence vs 0% hits with real diverse data
- **Bulk Data Loading**: Poor user experience with no progress visibility, memory pressure issues
- **Basic Memory Management**: Context grew indefinitely causing performance degradation over time

### **WHAT WORKED:**
- **Multi-Dimensional Complexity Scoring**: 4-factor analysis (technical, sentiment, length, domain) achieved 63.3% cost reduction
